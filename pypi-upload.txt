What to do to release a new version to pypi:

(Source: https://packaging.python.org/distributing/)

Change to project directory
Update version in setup.py

Better also update version in docs/conf.py and debian/changelog (run "dch -i")

# bdist sdist doesn't seem to work anymore with "twine upload"
#$ python3 setup.py bdist sdist

$ python3 setup.py sdist


Packages should now be in $PROJECTDIR/dist/

For uploading to PyPi:
- need ~/.pypirc with correct credentials
$ twine upload dist/*
