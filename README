==========

This is a Python3 library for reading and writing WSL data.

WSL is a text format for relational databases:

To generate documentation, use the Sphinx source under doc/. For example,

$ make -C doc/ html

It needs the Sphinx autodoc extension, and the relatively new `napoleon`
extension (which is not in Debian jessie but stretch).
